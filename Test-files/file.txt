Step 1: Reading the data

Machine learning models and Deep learning networks are usually trained using large volumes

CSV format. This data needs to be read before

of data called datasets, often stored

procession. An example of how this is done is as shown below:

code:

Import pandas

my_data = pandas.read_csv(‘ENTER_THE_PATH_TO_THE_DATASET_FILE.csv’)

Step 2: Cleaning the data

After the data has been read and stored in a variable (my_data) as seen above, we have to

ensure that no rows or column spaces are empty. We can simply p

out ‘my_data’ and see

how it looks. But since this data may be too much, we may not be able to detect the empty

spaces with our eyes. We have to use pandas. Spaces are generally denoted as NaN, so we can

do the following:
